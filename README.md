Functions are an essential part of Python programming, and mastering them is crucial for writing efficient and reusable code.
The len() Function in Python: The len() function is used to calculate the number of elements in an object, such as a list, string, or tuple. For example, when working with lists, len() helps to determine the size of the list dynamically. Here's an example of finding the length of a list using len().

Greeting Function: created a function greet() that takes a person's name as input and prints a personalized greeting..

Finding the Maximum Value Without max(): One of the tasks involves creating a function find_maximum(numbers) that identifies the maximum value in a list without using Python's built-in max() function. This is done using a loop to compare each element in the list.

Local vs. Global Variables: explained the difference between local and global variables with a practical program. The script demonstrates how Python handles variables with the same name differently based on their scope. It also shows how to modify a global variable inside a function using the global keyword.

Default Arguments in Functions: Lastly,use of default arguments in Python functions with a function calculate_area(length, width=5). This function calculates the area of a rectangle, and when the width argument is omitted, it defaults to 5. also included examples of how the function behaves with and without providing the width argument.
